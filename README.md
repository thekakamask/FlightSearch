# ✈️ **FlightSearch**
**FlightSearch** is a modern Android application that allows users to search for flights departing from any airport using IATA codes or airport names. It offers real-time auto-suggestions based on a local Room database, and allows users to save their favorite routes. The app follows modern Android development practices with **Room**, **ViewModel**, **StateFlow**, and **Preferences DataStore**, structured around the **MVVM** architecture.


## ✅ **LAST MAJOR UPDATES**

- 🧱 Designed and implemented the **local SQLite database using Room**:
  - Defined `Airport` and `Favorite` entities matching the prebuilt database scheme.
  - Integrated a pre-populated Room database (`flight_search.db`) using `.createFromAsset(...)`.
  - Created `AirportDao` and `FavoriteDao` with SQL queries for search, selection, and favorite route tracking.

- 🧠 Built the **Repository** layer:
  - Defined `AirportRepository` and `FavoriteRepository` interfaces.
  - Implemented `OfflineAirportRepository` and `OfflineFavoriteRepository` classes using Room DAOs.
  - Exposed database results as `Flow<T>` for reactive and lifecycle-aware UI updates.

- 🧩 Implemented **Dependency** injection setup:
  - Created `AppContainer` interface for managing shared dependencies.
  - Built `AppDataContainer` to provide repository instances from the Room database.
  - Integrated everything into `FlightSearchApplication` for global access to dependencies.

- 💾 Added **User Preferences DataStore** support:
  - Defined `IUserPreferencesRepository` and implemented `UserPreferencesRepository` for persistent search query storage.
  - Used `Preferences DataStore` to persist the latest search query (`search_query`) with `stringPreferencesKey`.
  - Injected via `AppContainer` for access from the `ViewModel`.

- 🎛️ Structured the **UI State management**:
   - Defined `FlightUiState` to represent the complete state of the search screen, including search query, results, favorites, and loading/error state.
   - Created `FlightUiModel` to represent enriched flight route items (departure, destination, favorite status).
      
## ❌ **NEXT UPDATES**

- 🧠 Finalize ViewModel logic:
  - Inject repositories into the ViewModel.
  - Implement search + favorite logic using repositories.

- 📦 Create the `ViewModel` and initial `UiState`:
  - Connect search input to the database via repository.
  - Reflect database results in a composable `StateFlow`.

- 🔍 Implement the search screen UI:
  - Add `TextField` with auto-complete support.
  - Display real-time filtered results from Room.

- ❤️ Add favorites logic (DataStore + Room):
  - Mark routes as favorites and persist selection.
  - Display favorite routes when no search is active.
